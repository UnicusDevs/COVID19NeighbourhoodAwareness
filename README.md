# COVID-19 Community Project

  - This project was planned, designed and developed my Mark Tominson, Mahes Varier and Max Kelly. 
  - The idea of this project came from a 7:30 news report saying how the only way to defeat this virus is if we all work as a community. This got us thinking on how we can make the community more aware of what each person is doing on a simple level of just reporting they self-isolated to the people in their suburbs. 
  - The future of this project is that we want communities to post what they need assistance with whether that be walking their dog, getting groceries etc... This would all be volunteer work. The aim of this is to activate the community to help one another.
